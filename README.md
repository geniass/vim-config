vim-config
==========

Repo of my vim plugins and vimrc

Stuff that needs to be installed seperately:

* Vim/gVim (Obviously)
* ack
* git
* jedi (from pip)
* pep8 (pip)
* Patched font eg. https://github.com/pdf/ubuntu-mono-powerline-ttf/
* [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)


For Vundle (do this first):
        `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
